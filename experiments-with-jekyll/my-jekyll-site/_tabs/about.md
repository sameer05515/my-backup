# Hi

<!-- I'm Haotian MA, a doctoral researcher at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) focusing on applying data-driven method to accelerate the arrival of a sustainable energy fueled future.

I have a strong academic background in computer engineering, including completion of the [Institute of Data, System and Society, MIT](https://idss.mit.edu/) Summer Program and obtained a master's degree from the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/). I've finished impactful projects at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) and the [Global Energy Interconnection Research Institute](https://geiri.eu/).

My bachelor's degree in engineering was obtained from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) with more than 20 different level honors and awards for energy projects, and finally I was rewarded as 2019 outstanding bachelor graduates of SEU.

With over two years of experience in the energy sector, I've applied data-driven methods to further optimize energy systems, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance efficiency and security, resulting in contributions to publications and patents in the field.
