    "description": [
      "The Bhagavad Gita, or the song of God, was revealed by Lord Shree Krishna to Arjun on the threshold of the epic war of Mahabharata. A decisive battle between two sets of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, was just about to commence on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. A detailed account of the reasons that led to such a colossal war; is given under Introduction-The Setting of the Bhagavad Gita.",
      "The Bhagavad Gita is primarily a conversation between Lord Shree Krishna and Arjun. However, the first chapter begins with a dialogue between King Dhritarashtra and his minister Sanjay. Dhritarashtra being blind, could not leave his palace in Hastinapur but was eager to know the ongoings of the battlefield. Sanjay was a disciple of Sage Ved Vyas, the author of the epic Mahabharata and several other Hindu scriptures. Sage Ved Vyas possessed a mystic ability to see and hear events occurring in distant places. He had bestowed upon Sanjay the miraculous power of distant vision. Therefore, Sanjay could see and hear what transpired on the battleground of Kurukshetra, and gave a first-hand account to King Dhritarashtra, while still being in his palace."

      "In this chapter, Arjun reiterates to Shree Krishna that he is unable to cope with his current situation, where he has to kill his elders and teachers. He refuses to take part in such a battle and requests Shree Krishna to be his spiritual teacher and guide him on the proper path of action. Then the Supreme Lord starts imparting divine knowledge to Arjun. He begins with the immortal-nature of the soul, which is eternal and imperishable. Death only destroys the physical body, but the soul continues its journey.  Just as a person discards his old clothes and adorns new ones, the soul keeps changing bodies from one lifetime to another.",
      "The Lord then reminds Arjun that his social responsibility as a warrior is to fight for upholding righteousness. He explains that performing one’s social duty is a virtuous act that can take him to the celestial abodes, while dereliction only leads to infamy and humiliation.",
      "At first, Shree Krishna tries to motivate Arjun at a mundane level. Then he moves deeper and starts explaining to Arjun the Science of Work. He asks Arjun to perform his deeds without any attachment to their fruits. This science of working without desire for rewards is called the yog of the intellect or Buddhi-Yog. He further advises that the intellect should be used to control the desire for rewards from work. By working with such intent, the bondage-creating karmas get transformed into bondage-breaking karmas and a state beyond sorrows can be attained.",
      "Arjun is curious to know more about those who are situated in divine consciousness. Shree Krishna, therefore, describes how persons who have attained transcendence are free from attachment, fear, and anger. They are undisturbed and equipoised in every situation. With their senses subdued, they keep their minds always absorbed in God. He also explains the progression of afflictions of the mind—such as greed, anger, lust, etc. and advises how these can be overcome."

      "Shree Krishna expounds Karm Yog or the Yog of Action in this chapter. He explains to Arjun that nobody can remain without action, even for a moment. Bound by their inherent modes of nature, all beings are always engaged in some work. Superior are those who practice Karm Yog and continue to work diligently to fulfill their responsibilities externally, but internally they are unattached to them. However, the hypocrites display external renunciation but internally dwell upon the objects of their senses.",
      "Shree Krishna says that all living beings are an integral part of God’s creation and have roles and responsibilities to fulfill. Vedas prescribe performing yajña to please the celestial gods, who in-return bestow material gains. These yajñas cause rains to fall, which aids in the production of food grains for the sustenance of life on earth. Those who live only for the delight of their senses and do not accept their responsibility in this cycle— are sinful and living in vain. However, Shree Krishna says that when works or prescribed duties are performed as an obligation to God, they are also considered yajña (sacrifice).",
      "He then explains that unlike the rest of the humankind, the enlightened souls are not obliged to fulfill their bodily responsibilities. They are situated in knowledge of the self and execute higher responsibilities of the soul. However, they do not abandon their social duties, as it may create disharmony in the minds of the common people who look up to them for inspiration. Therefore, the wise continue to work without any personal motive only to set good examples for others to follow, else, the ignorant may abandon their prescribed duties prematurely. Shree Krishna mentions one such example of the enlightened King Janak, who performed his earthly duties as an ideal king and father.",
      "Arjun then asks Shree Krishna why people commit sin, even when unwilling, as if by some force. Lord Krishna explains that lust alone is the sinful all-devouring enemy. Similar to a fire that is covered by smoke or a mirror covered in dust, desire shrouds one’s knowledge and deludes the intellect. In the end, Shree Krishna advises Arjun that by controlling the senses, mind, and intellect—one can slay this enemy called desire, which is an embodiment of sin."

      "To strengthen Arjun’s faith in the knowledge He is imparting, Shree Krishna reveals His pristine origin in this chapter. He says, “Arjun, as you are my devotee and a dear friend, I am revealing this supreme science of Yog to you. It is the same eternal science that I taught to the Sun God at the beginning of time. And in a continuous tradition, the same knowledge was passed to the saintly kings.” Arjun wonders how someone who is almost his age could exist so many eons ago. He asks Shree Krishna how is it possible that you gave this knowledge to the Sun God and the others so many years back in time. To clarify Arjun’s doubts, Shree Krishna discloses the divine mystery of his descension. He says that although God is unborn and eternal, it is to establish dharma (the path of righteousness) that He descends on this earth by His Yogmaya power. His birth and activities are divine and cannot get tainted by material imperfections. Once a devotee knows this secret and engages in devotion with great faith, he attains God and does not take birth in this world again.",
      "Shree Krishna then continues to explain the nature of work and its three principles: action, in-action, and forbidden action. He explains—how the karm yogis, even while performing the most engaging task, are in the state of inaction and do not get entangled in the karmic reactions of such action. Knowing this—the ancient sages performed all their work as an act of sacrifice for the pleasure of God. They were not affected by happiness, distress, success, or failure. He explains that when sacrifice is suitably dedicated, performed with proper knowledge and pure sentiments, then its remnants become like nectar. And by partaking such nectar, the devotees are cleansed of all impurities. Even the biggest sinner can cross over the ocean of material miseries by boarding this boat of eternal knowledge. However, such knowledge should be acquired—only from a genuine spiritual master, who himself is God-realized. Being his Guru, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to cut apart all doubts that have arisen in his heart with this sword of knowledge. He asks Arjun to now get up and perform his duty as a warrior."

    "description": [
      "In this chapter, Shree Krishna compares karm sanyās yog (the path of renunciation of actions) with karm-yog (the path of work in devotion). He says: we can choose either of the two paths, as both lead to the same destination. However, he explains that renunciation of actions is rather challenging and can only be performed flawlessly by those whose minds are adequately pure. And purification of the mind can only be achieved by working in devotion. Therefore, karm-yog is a more appropriate path for the majority of humankind.",
      "The karm yogis with a purified intellect perform their worldly duties without any attachment to its fruit. They dedicate all their works and its results to God. Just as a lotus leaf that floats on water does not get wet, the karm yogis also remain unaffected by sin. They are aware that the soul resides within the body that is like a city with nine gates. Therefore, they do not consider themselves to be the doer nor the enjoyer of their actions. Endowed with the vision of equality, they look equally upon a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater. Seated in the Absolute Truth, such truly learned people develop flawless qualities similar to God. The ignorant worldly people do not realize that the pleasures they strive to relish from their sense objects are the very source of their misery. However, the Karm Yogis do not get any joy from such worldly pleasures. Instead, they enjoy the bliss of God who resides inside them.",
      "Lord Shree Krishna then describes karm sanyās yog or the path of renunciation. He says that the karm sanyāsīs control their mind, intellect, and senses by performing several austerities. By shutting out all their thoughts of external pleasures, they become free from fear, desire, and anger. And by including devotion to God in all their austerities, they attain long-lasting peace."

      "Shree Krishna continues the comparative evaluation between Karm Yog (the practice of spirituality while performing worldly duties) and Karm Sanyas (the practice of spirituality in a renounced state) in this chapter. He reiterates that Karm Yog is a more practicable path than Karm Sanyas. When work is done with devotion, it purifies the mind and enhances the spiritual realization. The mind then becomes tranquil, and meditation becomes the primary means of elevation. The yogis strive to conquer the mind through meditation because, while a trained mind is the best friend, an untrained mind can be the worst enemy for a spiritual aspirant. He cautions Arjun that by merely engaging in severe austerities, one cannot progress on the spiritual path. Therefore, moderation must be maintained, even in basic necessities like food, sleep, work, recreation, etc.",
      "Shree Krishna then explains yog sādhanā or the spiritual practice for uniting the mind with God. He says, similar to a lamp that does not flicker in a windless place: a sādhak should practice keeping his mind steady in meditation. He agrees that it is difficult to restrain the mind, but it can be controlled by practice and detachment. Therefore, whenever it wanders away, one needs to bring it back and continue to focus upon God. Then the mind gets purified and is established in transcendence or samādhi, which is a joyous state where one experiences infinite divine bliss.",
      "Arjun asks what happens to those spiritual aspirants who begin their journey, but due to an unsteady mind, they are unable to reach their goal. Shree Krishna reassures him that those who strive for God-realization are able to overcome evil. God keeps an account of all our accumulated spiritual merits from past lives and reawakens their wisdom in future births.  In this way, they can continue their journey from where they had left off. And with the help of their accrued merits from previous lives, in their present life, the yogis fast track towards God.",
      "The Lord then concludes this chapter with a declaration that the yogi (who strives to unite with God) is superior to the tapasvī (ascetic), the jñānī (person of learning), and the karmī (ritualistic performer). And highest among all the yogis is the one who engages in bhakti (loving devotion of God)."

      "This chapter begins with Shree Krishna describing the material and spiritual dimensions of God’s energies. He explains that similar to beads strung on a single thread, all these energies have originated from Him and rest in Him. The entire creation begins and dissolves into Him. Although it is very difficult to overcome His material energy Maya, those who surrender to Him can easily cross over it by His grace.",
      "He then describes the four kinds of people who engage in His devotion and the other four who do not surrender to Him. He says that those devotees who worship Him in knowledge with their mind and intellect merged in Him, are dearest to Him. Yet, some are deluded by material desires and surrender to the celestial gods, who bestow upon them temporary material prosperity. However, these celestial gods also get their powers from the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the worthiest object of devotion is the Almighty God Himself.",
      "Shree Krishna further confirms that He is the ultimate truth and the highest authority. He possesses several divine attributes such as omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience. However, His divine Yogmaya power hides His imperishable nature and eternal divine form. Those devotees who surrender to Him and take His shelter receive the divine knowledge of the Supreme God, the self, and the entire field of the karmic actions."

      "In this chapter, Shree Krishna briefly describes several significant concepts and terms that the Upanishads expound in detail. He also explains what decides the destination of the soul after death. He says that if we remember God at the time of death, we can definitely attain Him. Therefore, alongside doing our daily works, we must practice to always think of God. We can do this by thinking of His Qualities, Attributes, Virtues, etc. A persistent yogic meditation upon God by chanting His Names is also a good practice. Through exclusive devotion, when our mind is perfectly absorbed in Him, we will elevate from the material dimension to the spiritual realm.",
      "Shree Krishna then talks about the various abodes in the material realm and the cycle of creation. He further explains how the multitudes of beings’ manifest on these abodes, and at the time of dissolution, everything absorbs back into Him. However, the divine Abode of God is untouched by this cycle of creation and dissolution. Those who progress on the path of light finally reach the divine abode and never return to the material world. Whereas those fallen souls who tread the path of darkness endlessly keep transmigrating in the cycle of birth, old age, sickness, and death."

      "In the two previous chapters, the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna declared that among all, bhakti is the highest, yet the simplest path of attaining Yog, or union with the Supreme. In this chapter, He reveals His supreme glories that inspire reverence, devotion, and awe. Although Shree Krishna stands in front of Arjun in His personal form, this form should not be mistaken to possess human personality. At the beginning of creation, the Supreme Lord creates innumerable life-forms with His material energy. And at dissolution, He absorbs them back into Himself, and in the next cycle of creation, He manifests them again. All living beings’ dwell within Him, like the mighty winds that blow everywhere, yet always stay within the sky. However, He remains ever aloof and detached from all these activities as a neutral observer by His divine Yogmaya power.",
      "To resolve the apparent confusion of the Hindu pantheon, Shree Krishna explains that there is only one God, who is the sole object of worship. For all living beings, He is the true friend, the support, refuge, and the final goal. Therefore, those souls who engage in exclusive devotion towards the Supreme Lord go to His abode and remain there. Those influenced by the ritualistic ceremonies described in the Vedas also attain the celestial abodes. However, when their merits are exhausted, they must return to earth. Saying this, Shree Krishna exalts the superiority of pure bhakti solely directed toward Him. Such a devotee lives in complete union with God’s will, doing everything for Him and offering everything to Him. Such pure devotion helps devotees attain the mystic union with God and releases them from the bondage of Karmas.",
      "Shree Krishna asserts that He is impartial towards all creatures; He neither favors nor rejects anyone. Even if despicable sinners come to His shelter, He accepts them willingly and very quickly makes them pure and virtuous. Shree Krishna then says that He is seated within His devotees and will not let them perish. He preserves what they possess and provides them what they lack. Hence, we should dedicate our mind and body to Him, worship Him, always think of Him, and make Him our supreme goal."

      "The previous chapter revealed the science of bhakti or loving devotion of God. In this chapter, Shree Krishna desires to increase Arjun’s bhakti by describing His infinite glories and opulence. The verses are not only pleasing to read, but also enchanting to hear. He helps Arjun to meditate on God by reflecting upon His magnificence.",
      "He reveals that He is the source of all that exists. From His mind, the seven great sages, the four great saints, and the fourteen Manus were born. All the people of this world then descended from them. The various exceptional qualities in humans also arise from Him. Those devotees who know this engage in His devotion with great faith. They derive immense satisfaction by conversing about His glories and also help enlightening others about them. God dwells in the hearts of such devotees whose mind is always united in Him. He then bestows upon them His divine knowledge, through which they can attain God-realization.",
      "Arjun is now fully convinced that Shree Krishna is the Supreme Divine Personality and requests Him to describe further His divine glories, which are like divine nectar. Then Lord Shree Krishna reveals that everything that exists is a manifestation of His energies. He is the beginning, middle, and end of all; the infinite reservoir of knowledge, power, beauty, and glory. All beings and things get their splendor from Him; He is the powerhouse of magnificence. Whatever catches our imagination and infuses us with bliss is nothing but a tiny spark of His opulence.",
      "The rest of the chapter describes the personalities, objects, and activities that best display His magnificence. Shree Krishna finally says that the magnitude of His glory cannot be described in words, as within a fraction of His being, He upholds infinite universes. Since God is the source of all the splendor and glory, we must make Him the object of our devotion."

      "In the previous chapter, Shree Krishna described his divine vibhūtis (opulences) to nourish and increase Arjun’s devotion. At the end, he faintly alluded to his universal cosmic form, by saying that all things beautiful, glorious, and powerful manifest from just a spark of his splendor. In this chapter, Arjun requests to see Shree Krishna’s viśhwarūp, or the infinite cosmic form of God that encompasses all the universes. Shree Krishna obliges by granting him divine vision. Arjun then sees the totality of creation in the body of the God of gods. He observes unlimited faces, eyes, arms, and stomachs in the wonderful and infinite form of the Lord. The form has no beginning or end, and extends infinitely in every direction. The splendor of that form is more than a thousand suns blazing forth together in the sky. The vision makes Arjun’s hair stand on end. He sees the three worlds trembling in fear of God’s laws. He witnesses the celestial gods taking shelter of him and the great sages extolling him with profuse hymns and prayers. He observers all the sons of Dhritarasthra along with their allied kings rushing headlong into the mouth of that fearsome form, as moths rushing with great speed into the fire to perish. Arjun then confesses that on beholding the universal form his heart is trembling with fear and he has lost his peace of mind. Terrified, he wishes to know the identity of this awesome God, who bears no resemblance now to the Krishna he had known as his teacher and friend. Shree Krishna responds by saying that in the form of time he is the destroyer of the three worlds. He declares that the great Kaurava warriors have already been killed by him, so being assured of victory, Arjun should get up and fight.",
      "In response, Arjun praises him as the Lord who possesses infinite valor and power, and offers him repeated salutations. He asks for forgiveness if during their long friendship he has ever done anything to offend the Lord through mistaking him for a mere human being. He implores for grace and requests to see once again the pleasing form of God. Shree Krishna grants his desire and first returns to his four-armed form, and then to his gentle and loving two-armed form. He tells Arjun how difficult it is to have a vision of God in the manner that Arjun is seeing him. His personal form cannot be seen by the study of the Vedas, nor by penance, charity, or fire sacrifices. By unalloyed devotion alone can one know him as he is, standing before Arjun, and enter into union with him."

      "This small chapter stresses on the super-excellence of the path of loving devotion over all other types of spiritual practices.  It begins with Arjun asking Shree Krishna whom He considers more perfect in Yog—those who are devoted to the personal form of God or those who worship the formless Brahman.  Shree Krishna responds by declaring that both paths lead to God-realization.  However, He regards the devotees of His personal form as the best yogis.  He explains that meditation on the impersonal unmanifest aspect of God is full of tribulations and is exceedingly difficult for embodied beings.  But devotees of the personal form, with their consciousness merged in Him and all their actions dedicated to Him, are swiftly delivered from the cycle of life and death.  Shree Krishna thus asks Arjun to surrender his intellect to Him, and fix his mind in exclusive loving devotion on Him alone. ",
      "However, such love is often not forthcoming in the struggling soul.  So Shree Krishna gives other options, and says that if Arjun cannot immediately reach the stage of complete absorption of the mind in God, he should strive to reach that stage of perfection by constant practice.  Devotion is not a mysterious gift and can be cultivated by regular effort.  If Arjun cannot do even this much, he should still not admit defeat; rather he should work in devotion for the pleasure of Shree Krishna.  If this is also not possible, then he should merely renounce the fruits of his works and be situated in the self.  He then explains that higher than mechanical practice is the cultivation of knowledge; higher than the cultivation of knowledge is meditation; and higher than meditation is the renunciation of fruits of actions, which immediately leads to great peace.  The remaining verses of the chapter describe the wonderful qualities of God’s loving devotees who are very dear to Him."

    "description": [
      "The Bhagavad Gita consists of eighteen chapters, which are composed of three segments.  The first set of six chapters describes karm-yog.  The second set describes the glories of bhakti, and for the nourishment of bhakti, it also dwells upon the opulences of God.  The third set of six chapters expounds upon tattva jñāna (knowledge scriptural terms and principles).  The present one is the first of the third set of chapters, and it introduces two terms—kṣhetra (the “field”) and kṣhetrajña (the “knower of the field”).  We may think of the field as the body and the knower of the field as the soul that resides within.  But this is a simplification, for the field is actually much more—it includes the mind, intellect, and ego, and all other components of the material energy that comprise our personality.  In this wider sense, the field of the body encompasses all aspects of our personality, except for the soul who is the “knower the field.” ",
      "As a farmer sows seeds in a field and reaps the harvest from it, we sow the field of our body with good or bad thoughts and actions, and reap the consequent destiny.  The Buddha had explained: “All that we are is the result of what we have thought; it is founded on our thoughts; and it is made of our thoughts.”  Therefore, as we think, that is what we become.  The great American thinker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, said: “The ancestor of every action is thought.”  Thus, we must learn the art of cultivating the field of our body with appropriate thoughts and actions.  This requires knowledge of the distinction between the field and the knower of the field.  In the present chapter, Shree Krishna goes into a detailed analysis of this distinction.  He enumerates the elements of material nature that compose the field of the body.  He describes the modifications that arise in the field, in the form of emotions, sentiments, and feelings.  He also mentions the virtues and qualities that purify the field and illumine it with the light of knowledge.  Such knowledge helps us gain realization of the soul, who is the knower of the field.  The chapter then describes God, who is the supreme knower of the fields of all the living beings.  That Supreme Lord holds contradictory attributes, i.e. He possesses opposite qualities at the same time.  So, He is all-pervading in creation and yet seated in the hearts of all living beings.  He is thus the Supreme Soul of all living beings. ",
      "Having described the soul, the Supreme Soul, and material nature, Shree Krishna then explains which of these is responsible for actions by living beings, and also which is responsible for cause and effect in the world at large.  Those, who can perceive these distinctions and properly pinpoint the causes of action, are the ones who actually see; and they are the ones who are situated in knowledge.  They observe the Supreme Soul present in all living beings, and so they do not degrade themselves by their mind.  They can see the variety of living beings situated in the same material nature.  And when they see the common spiritual substratum pervading all existence, they attain the realization of Brahman."

      "The previous chapter explained in detail the distinction between the soul and the material body. This chapter describes the nature of the material energy, which is the source of the body and its elements, and is thus the origin of both mind and matter. Shree Krishna explains that material nature is constituted of three modes (guṇas)—goodness, passion, and ignorance. The body, mind, and intellect that are made from the material energy also possess these three modes, and the mix of the modes in our being determines the color of our personality. The mode of goodness is characterized by peacefulness, well-being, virtue, and serenity; the mode of passion gives rise to endless desires and insatiable ambitions for worldly enhancement; and the mode of ignorance is the cause for delusion, laziness, intoxication, and sleep. Until the soul attains illumination, it must learn to deal with these three powerful forces of material nature. Liberation lies in transcending all three of these modes.",
      "Shree Krishna reveals a simple solution for breaking out of the bondage of these guṇas. The Supreme Lord is transcendental to the three modes, and if we attach ourselves to him, then our mind will also rise to the divine platform. At this point, Arjun enquires about the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three guṇas. Shree Krishna then systematically explains the traits of such liberated souls. He explains that illumined persons remain ever equipoised; they are not disturbed when they see the guṇas functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations. They see everything as a manifestation of God’s energies, which are ultimately in his hands. Thus, worldly situations neither make them jubilant nor miserable, and without wavering, they remain established in the self. The chapter ends with Shree Krishna again reminding us of the power of devotion and its ability to make us transcend the three guṇas."

    "description": [
      "In the previous chapter, Shree Krishna explained that by transcending the three modes of material nature one attains the divine goal.  He also revealed that the best means for going beyond the guṇas is to engage in exclusive devotion.  To engage in such devotion, we must detach the mind from the world and attach it to God alone.  Thus, it is necessary to understand the nature of the world.  In this chapter, Shree Krishna explains this material world in a graphic manner, to help Arjun develop detachment from it.   He compares the material world to an upside down aśhvatth tree (sacred fig).  The embodied soul wanders up and down the branches of the tree, from lifetime to lifetime, without comprehending from where it originated, how long it has existed, and how it keeps growing.  The roots of the tree are above, as it has its source in God.  The fruitive activities described in the Vedas are like its leaves.  The tree is irrigated by the three modes of material nature.  These modes create sense objects that are like the buds on the tree.  The buds sprout aerial roots that engender further growth of the tree.  The chapter describes this symbolism in detail, to convey the idea of how the embodied soul suffering in this material world only keeps perpetuating its bondage here, in ignorance of the nature of this tree of material existence.  Shree Krishna explains that the axe of detachment must be used to cut down the tree.  Then, we must search for the base of the tree, which is the Supreme Lord Himself.  Finding the source, we must surrender to Him in the manner described in this chapter, and then will attain the divine Abode of God, from where we will not return to the material world again.  ",
      "Shree Krishna then describes how the souls in this world are divine, being His eternal fragmental parts.  But bound by material nature, they are struggling with the six senses including the mind.  He explains how the embodied soul, though divine, savors the material objects of the senses.  He also describes how the soul transmigrates to a new body at the time of death, carrying with it the mind and senses from the present life.  The ignorant neither realize the presence of the soul in the body, nor when it departs from it upon death.  But yogis perceive it with the eyes of knowledge and by the purity of their mind.  In the same way, God is also present in His creation, but He needs to be perceived with the eyes of knowledge.  Shree Krishna reveals how we can cognize the existence of God in this world through His glories that shine forth everywhere.  The chapter ends with explanations of the terms: kṣhar, akṣhar, and Puruṣhottam.  Kṣhar are the perishable beings of the material realm.  Akṣhar are the liberated beings in the Abode of God.  Puruṣhottam is the Supreme Divine Personality, who is the unchanging controller and sustainer of the world.  He is transcendental to both the perishable and imperishable beings.  He must be worshipped with all our being."

      "In this chapter, Shree Krishna describes the two kinds of natures amongst human beings—the saintly and the demoniac. The saintly nature develops by following the instructions of the scriptures, cultivating the mode of goodness, and purifying the mind through spiritual practices. It leads to the enhancement of daivī sampatti (godly qualities), eventually culminating in God-realization. In contrast, there is also the demoniac nature that develops from associating with the modes of passion and ignorance, and embracing materialistic views. It breeds unwholesome traits in one’s personality, and eventually throws the soul into hellish kinds of existence.",
      "The chapter begins by describing the saintly virtues of those endowed with a divine nature. It then goes on to describe the demoniac qualities that must be scrupulously shunned because they drag the soul further into ignorance and the samsara of life and death. Shree Krishna concludes the chapter by saying that the scriptures should be our authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done. We must understand these scriptural injunctions and then perform our actions in this world accordingly."

      "In the fourteenth chapter, Shree Krishna had explained the three modes of material nature and the manner in which they hold sway over humans. In this seventeenth chapter, he goes into greater detail about the influence of the guṇas. First, he discusses the topic of faith and explains that nobody is devoid of faith, for it is an inseparable aspect of human nature. But depending upon the nature of their mind, people’s faith takes on a corresponding color—sāttvic, rājasic, or tāmasic. The nature of their faith determines the quality of their life. People also prefer food according to their dispositions. Shree Krishna classifies food into three categories and discusses the impact of each of these upon us. He then moves on to the topic of sacrifice (yajña) and how, in each of the three modes of nature, sacrifice takes on different forms. The chapter moves on to the subject of austerity (tapaḥ), and explains austerities of the body, speech, and mind. Each of these kinds of austerity takes on a different form as influenced by the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance. The topic of charity (dān) is then discussed, and its three-fold divisions are described.",
      "Finally, Shree Krishna goes beyond the three guṇas and explains the relevance and import of the words “Om Tat Sat,” which symbolize different aspects of the Absolute Truth. The syllable “Om” is a symbolic representation of the impersonal aspect of God; the syllable “Tat” is uttered for consecrating activities and ceremonies to the Supreme Lord; the syllable “Sat” means eternal goodness and virtue. Taken together, they usher the concept of transcendence. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the futility of acts of sacrifice, austerity, and charity, which are done without regard to the injunctions of the scriptures."

    "description": [
      "The final chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is the longest and covers many subjects. Arjun initiates the topic of renunciation with a question about two commonly used Sanskrit words, sanyās (renunciation of actions) and tyāg (renunciation of desires). Both words come from roots words meaning “to abandon.” A sanyāsī (monk) is one who does not participate in family life and withdraws from society to practice sādhanā (spiritual discipline). A tyāgī is one who engages in activities but gives up selfish desire for enjoying the rewards of actions (this is the connotation of the word in the Gita). Shree Krishna recommends the second kind of renunciation. He advises that sacrifice, charity, penance, and other acts of duty should never be renounced, for they purify even the wise. Rather, they should be performed as a matter of duty simply because they ought to be done, without any attachment to the fruits of these actions.",
      "Then, Shree Krishna goes into a detailed analysis of the three factors that motivate action, the three constituents of action, and the five factors that contribute to the result of action. He describes each of these in terms of the three guṇas. He establishes that those with deficient understanding see themselves as the only cause of their works. But the enlightened souls, with purified intellect, neither consider themselves as the doer nor the enjoyer of their actions. Ever detached from the fruits of what they do, they are not bound in karmic reactions. The chapter then explains why people differ in their motives and activities. According to the three modes of material nature, it describes the kinds of knowledge, the types of actions, and the categories of performers. It then offers the same analysis for the intellect, resolve, and happiness. The chapter then goes on to paint a picture of those who have attained perfection in spiritual life and are situated in Brahman-realization. It adds that even such perfect yogis find completion in their realization by engaging in bhakti. Thus, the secret of the Supreme Divine Personality can only be known through loving devotion.",
      "Shree Krishna then reminds Arjun that God dwells in the hearts of all living beings, and directs their wanderings according to their karmas. If we remember him and dedicate all our activities to him, taking shelter of him and making him our supreme goal, then by his grace we will overcome all obstacles and difficulties. But if, motivated by pride, we act according to our whims, we will not attain success. Finally, Shree Krishna reveals that the most confidential knowledge is to abandon all varieties of religiosity and simply surrender to God. However, this knowledge should not be given to those who are not austere or devoted, for they will misinterpret it and mis-utilize it to irresponsibly abandon actions. But if we explain this confidential knowledge to qualified souls, it is the greatest act of love and is very pleasing to God.",
      "Arjun then informs Shree Krishna that his illusion is dispelled and he is ready to act as instructed. In the end, Sanjay, who has been narrating the dialogue to the blind king Dhritarashtra remarks how amazed and astounded he is on hearing the divine conversation. His hair stands on end in ecstasy, as he recalls the sacred dialogue and remembers the stupendous cosmic form of God. He concludes with a profound pronouncement that victory will always be on the side of God and his pure devotee, and so will goodness, supremacy, and opulence, for the darkness of falsehood will always be vanquished by the light of the Absolute Truth."
