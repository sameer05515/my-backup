Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This post demonstrates how to use Jekyll with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

This setup includes:

- **Jekyll 4.3** - Modern static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Docker** - Containerized development environment
- **Best Practices** - Clean structure and configuration

## Getting Started

To start developing:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Writing Posts

Create new posts in the `_posts` directory with the format:

```

## Styling

This site uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the design by:

1. Editing `tailwind.config.js` for theme customization
2. Modifying `assets/css/main.css` for custom styles
3. Using Tailwind utility classes in your layouts and posts

Happy blogging!
